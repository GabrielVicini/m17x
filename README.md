# M17x

## Overview

This repository is a direct fork of the M17 C reference implementation.

As of now, nothing has been changed. No new features, no encryption layers, no modifications — this is simply a baseline clone to begin personal experimentation.

## Status

- Direct upstream clone  
- No added functionality  
- No added security  
- No encryption changes  

This project has just started and currently contains nothing new.

## Project Goals (Early / Experimental)

- Explore secure extensions to the M17 protocol  
- Experiment with authenticated payload encryption  
- Investigate session-layer key management concepts  
- Maintain compatibility with standard M17 framing? (Maybe)  
- Use this project as a learning platform for RF and protocol engineering  

These goals are exploratory and may change over time.
